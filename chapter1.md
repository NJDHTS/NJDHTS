# Quick Start Guide

## Roads Module Crash Querying

[**Roads **](https://njdhts.numetric.com/roads/crash-query#/)is the default module that loads automatically when you log in to the CAT. Beginner users should stick to this Roads module for quick and intuitive crash data querying and analysis. Data in this module is all aggregated at the crash level, so it can answer questions such as the following.

> When and where did the **crash** occur?
>
> Did alcohol or drug use contribute to the **crash**?
>
> What was the highest injury severity that occurred in the **crash**?
>
> Were any pedestrians involved in the **crash**?

## Safe Routes to School Tutorial

Safe Routes to School Travel Plans help municipalities interested in improving safe school access for their children as they walk or bike to school each day. We produced a step-by-step [**Safe Routes to School Tutorial**](/safe-routes-to-school.md)** **to** **guide users in how to use the CAT to make a pedestrian crash map to for their Safe Routes to School travel plan.

## Numetric Workbooks - Advanced
>**info**
>This section of the Crash Analysis Tool is still under development. An update will be sent to all CAT users once a beta version is complete.


###### For more advanced querying options, check out the [Numetric Workbooks \(Advanced\) ](/numetric-workbooks.md)guide. Advanced querying allows users to answer questions like the following:

> How many **pedestrians **in my jurisdiction were suspected under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of a crash?
>
> How many **occupants **in the back seat were not wearing seatbelts?

Advanced querying provides access to source data in all [NJ Statewide Crash Database](/numetric-workbooks/new-jersey-advanced-crash-tables.md) tables, as well as the [New Jersey State Police Fatal Crash Database](/numetric-workbooks/njsp-fatal-database.md), which provides accurate fatality statistics.
