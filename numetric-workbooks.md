## NJ Statewide Crash Database

To query basic information about the crash event, for example where crashes occurred, how severe they were, and basic safety emphasis areas, refer to the [Quick Start Guide](/chapter1.md) to the Roads module.

For advanced querying, the New Jersey Crash Database also contains more detailed information about other important aspects in addition to the basic crash information. These are organized in the following tables:

* Drivers
* Occupants
* Pedestrians and Bicyclists
* Vehicles

Examples of queries that could be answered with the basic Roads module versus the advanced Numetric Workbooks are as follows:

| Roads | Numetric Workbooks \(Advanced\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| How many crashes in my county involved pedestrians? | What percentage of those pedestrians were suspected under the influence of alcohol?|
| How many younger drivers were involved in crashes in my municipality? | Are young drivers of different ages more likely to be involved in fatal crashes? How many of those young drivers were drowsy or drunk? |

For more information on advanced querying of the NJ Statewide Crash Database, follow the [NJ Statewide Crash Database](/numetric-workbooks/new-jersey-advanced-crash-tables.md) tutorial.

## NJ State Police Fatal Crash Database

The most reliable source of fatal crash information is the NJ State Police \(NJSP\) Fatal Crash Database. Although the complete statewide crash database is useful for many analyses because of its comprehensive nature, in recent years, the number of fatalities reported in the statewide crash database has not been accurate \(including some duplicate or missing records\). Since fatal crashes are rare, accurate reporting of these crashes is essential to conduct preventative safety analysis and planning.

NJSP maintains its own database of all fatal crashes in New Jersey and reports these crashes to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \(NHTSA\)'s Fatal Accident Reporting System \(FARS\). In partnership with NJSP, we have provided access to this database through the Numetric Workbooks module of the CAT. The database is structured in three tables:

* Crashes
* Involved
* Vehicles

For more information on how to query fatal crashes, follow the [NJSP Fatal Crash Database](/numetric-workbooks/njsp-fatal-database.md) tutorial.
